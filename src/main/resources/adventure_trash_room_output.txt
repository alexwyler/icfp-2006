You are in a room with a pile of junk. A hallway leads south. 
There is a bolt here. 
Underneath the bolt, there is a spring. 
Underneath the spring, there is a button. 
Underneath the button, there is a (broken) processor. 
Underneath the processor, there is a red pill. 
Underneath the pill, there is a (broken) radio. 
Underneath the radio, there is a cache. 
Underneath the cache, there is a blue transistor. 
Underneath the transistor, there is an antenna. 
Underneath the antenna, there is a screw. 
Underneath the screw, there is a (broken) motherboard. 
Underneath the motherboard, there is a (broken) A-1920-IXB. 
Underneath the A-1920-IXB, there is a red transistor. 
Underneath the transistor, there is a (broken) keypad. 
Underneath the keypad, there is some trash. 

>: The processor is from the elusive 19x86 line. 
Also, it is broken: it is a processor missing a cache. 

>: The radio is a hi-fi AM/FM stereophonic radio.
Also, it is broken: it is a radio missing a transistor and an
antenna. 

>: The motherboard is well-used.
Also, it is broken: it is a motherboard missing a A-1920-IXB and
a screw. 

>: The A-1920-IXB is an exemplary instance of part number
A-1920-IXB. 
Also, it is broken: it is (a A-1920-IXB missing a transistor)
missing (a radio missing an antenna) and a processor and a bolt.

>: The keypad is labeled "use me".
Also, it is broken: it is a keypad missing a motherboard and a
button. 

>: The keypad has been destroyed.
